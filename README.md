This is a project of mine, I wanted to use django to make something interesting. 
This ecommerce allows users to see games and buy them.
The API can be used to retrieve all games in the database.
This is only a backend webapp, it doesn't have a javascript framework in the front.

- Python
- Django
- Django-rest-framework
